<ul>
	<li>Everyone suddenly remembers last night when they were watching the last episode that involves Kor. In reading order, everything is relettered to spell out its title.</li>
	<li>Somehow we’ve run out of C’s, so those are now unlettered instead.</li>
	<li>We couldn’t find any H’s, so we’re using Y’s instead.</li>
	<li>The nun in column H gets really confused. She and the car diagonal from her instead take the (previous) letter from the nun and car in the first row, respectively, while the nun 2 spaces from her didn’t get the memo and keeps her previous letter.</li>
