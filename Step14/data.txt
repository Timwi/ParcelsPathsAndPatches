<p>In this step, everything moves at most once. Things can move through each other though.</p>
<ol>
	<li>D4 moves as far as she can in a straight line diagonally while staying on seeded squares.</li>
	<li>The nun now immediately to her south makes a knight’s move to a “┌─” piece of the nun-bear link.</li>
	<li>A nun currently standing on a vowel in the crossword moves immediately north of the previous via a knight’s move.</li>
	<li>The only remaining nun who sees a car somewhere east of her moves to the last vacated square.</li>
	<li>The drum kit with the same letter as the previous move, moves to B7.</li>
	<li>A1 moves in an orthogonal direction to the furthest unoccupied seeded square.</li>
	<li>The only unlettered drum kit does likewise.</li>
	<li>The car in the largest parcel moves to the last vacated square.</li>
	<li>A nun moves west to be on an unoccupied square in the same column as the other nun with her letter.</li>
	<li>G4 moves south as far as she can while still ending up on an unseeded square.</li>
	<li>The only nun diagonal from her now, moves diagonally to an endpoint of a nun-bear link.</li>
	<li>The only remaining drum kit able to move south one square, does so.</li>
	<li>The only remaining nun able to move south-east three squares, does so.</li>
	<li>A car moves to a seeded square where it is within two squares of two other cars with the same letter.</li>
	<li>The only remaining item in column A moves to an unoccupied square at the top of a column containing exactly two seeded squares.</li>
	<li>The car with the latest letter in the alphabet moves to the space last vacated by a car.</li>
	<li>The last remaining lettered car moves to the square just vacated.</li>
	<li>H1 reflects her position about the only point a knight’s move away that is a corner in a nun-bear link.</li>
	<li>The last car moves to an unseeded R in the crossword that is not next to a P and not a straight segment of nun-bear link or barrier tape.</li>
	<li>The last nun moves to E4.</li>
