	<li>The groundskeeper is back to do his round on his motorized lawn mower.</li>
	<li>His route forms a closed, non-self-intersecting loop going through some squares in the grid.</li>
	<li>The lawn mower will make a 90° turn on a square with a nun. It will not turn on the square immediately before or after.</li>
	<li>The lawn mower will continue straight on a square with a car or a drum kit. If it went straight on the square immediately before, it makes a 90° turn immediately after.</li>
	<li>The guy is not very good at his job because he missed a few spots.</li>
