	<li>The groundskeeper has subdivided the area into patches.</li>
	<li>Plant seeds in some squares, but they need space, so don’t seed orthogonally adjacent squares.</li>
	<li>The nuns need to be able to tend to the plants later, so make sure the unseeded area is contiguous.</li>
	<li>If a patch contains a car, the number of seeds in that patch must equal the number of squares the car visited.</li>
	<li>Make sure that every orthogonal line connecting unseeded squares through two or more patch boundaries contains at least one seed.</li>
