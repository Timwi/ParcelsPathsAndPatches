	<li>Everyone now follows the lawn mower’s path (clockwise). Items with the same letter are numbered in reading order by their initial position. Unlettered items are referred to as X₁ etc.</li>
	<li>A walks one step less than I and seven steps less than M.</li>
	<li>E₁ walks twice as many steps as L and one step less than Y₂.</li>
	<li>E₂ walks one step less than R₂, and also as much as E₄ and O₁ combined.</li>
	<li>I walks as many steps more than T as T does more than E₁.</li>
	<li>L walks two steps less than Y₁.</li>
	<li>N₁ walks the next square number after Y₁.</li>
	<li>N₂ walks nine times as many steps as E₃, and also as much as E₃, L and O₁ combined.</li>
	<li>O₁ walks twice as many steps as E₃ and three more steps than U₂.</li>
	<li>O₂ walks as much as E₁, Y₁ and U₂ combined.</li>
	<li>R₁ walks twice as many steps as Y₂.</li>
	<li>R₂ walks as much as M, U₂ and Y₁ combined.</li>
	<li>T walks as many steps more than U₁ as U₁ does more than Y₂.</li>
	<li>T, U₁ and U₂ together walk as much as E₂.</li>
	<li>X₁ walks the next prime number after R₂.</li>
	<li>X₂ walks as much as O₁ and Y₂ combined.</li>
	<li>Y₁ walks four steps less than N₂.</li>
